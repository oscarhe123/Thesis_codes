orig: Originally trained model weights from DBlink Github
trained: Trained model weights using 32x32 img

sum1: sumfactor = 1, since generated data is already summed 10
sum10: sumfactor = 10, for testing , generated data is already summed 10

size32: referring to the img_size variable in the original DBlink/demo.py  filament simulation 
scale4: referring to the scale_factor variable in the original DBlink/demo.py filament simulation
